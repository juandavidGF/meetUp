# About
This project is a meetUp platform. It is in the Discovery product Development phase. The product development framework is based on Lean Startup, scientific method, and Experimento (Alex torrenegra framework). This Landing page is the start of this endeavour, the objective with this is to Test Demand.
The complexity of the project will increase following the validations (demand, usability, value, and technical feasibility)

The first version is built with vuejs and CSS.

The demand test will consist in post a message in some FB groups. If some persons click in the CTA (SingUp) button, the core hipotesis are validated if not It is invalidated.

The 1Â° version was post in my whatsapp status, nobody made registration, I supose because the landing is very basic, the people can distinge betwen something that appear real or interesting, to something that not. To improve the Landing, the idea is make more interviews, have moro data an insights, and add real places.

*The successful is the combination of discipline and take of risks*
